### 💻 About Me

### 💡 About Me

Hi there! I'm Vansh Arora — a passionate developer and AI enthusiast currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering at VIT Chennai. I love building things that solve real problems, especially at the intersection of **machine learning** and **full-stack web development**.

From developing gesture-controlled interfaces to real-time terrain detection systems, I’ve always been drawn to projects that push the boundaries of tech. I'm experienced with modern stacks like **React, Node.js, MongoDB**, and tools like **TensorFlow, OpenCV**, and **YOLOv8** for AI/ML applications.

I'm also active in hackathons, tech clubs, and open-source communities—constantly learning, collaborating, and leveling up. Whether it's clean code, a smarter model, or a slick UI, I’m all about building with purpose.

Let's connect and create something awesome!
